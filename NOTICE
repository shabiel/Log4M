Original code was developed by Joel Ivey while working for the VA from
2006-2008 onwards. Portions of the code were authored by Kevin Muldrum. Kevin's
code is still retained but is not being used. Both of them wrote the code as
federal employees.

The code was supposed to be released in Kernel Toolkit patch 81, but was never
offcially released.

Sam Habiel (current maintainer) has made changes to the code since 2012. He
grants use of the modified code under the Apache 2.0 license. Sam's contributions
are:

 * SAVEARR entry point.
 * Refactoring of Socket Code
 * ZWRITE entry point
 * Viewing log and clearing logs entry points
 * New documentation as Wiki on Github
 * Unit Tests moved from ZZ namespace to XTML namespace
 * New package created as Log4M in XTML Namespace
